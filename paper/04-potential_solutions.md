# Potential solutions

## Potential solutions to cultural challenges for digital chemistry in academic research:

To achieve the utopian ideal of open, interoperable data in chemistry, a joined-up approach is required. There are many interested parties when discussing academic research, from the top-down:
- Funding bodies cannot just expand their open access stipulations on funded research, but they must also increase their support for open tools, infrastructure and standards development. 
- Large collaborations and organizations, such as the Research Data Alliance (RDA) must encourage an open, equitable forum for discussion that identifies common problems across fields and enables the pooling of resources to find their solutions.
- Universities must widen their view beyond simple publication metrics when hiring (c.f. DORA), to incentivize the additional work required to perform open, robust science. This includes providing space and career paths for knowledge management specialists, research software engineers and digital librarians to assist and provide training to researcherâ€™s at all stages (through the traditional degree curricula and through schemes such as software and data carpentry workshops).
- Need something about industry e.g. guiding education practices at universities to be more digital, developing open source tools with standard data formats rather than proprietary
- Journals should tune their platforms to maximise the impact of open data, beyond just requiring links to archived supplementary information. As we start to move beyond publication-dominated research, journals and publishers must innovate to accommodate new models of peer review.
Individual researchers, particularly those in leadership positions, must acknowledge the importance and utility of digitizing their research; they can then seek to foster that culture in their respective research groups. This culture can then be proliferated through new collaborations to promote digital chemistry from the ground up.
- Culture is already shifting in this direction, but we must be wary of the next plateau in the path to interoperable chemical data.

## Potential solutions to technical challenges posed by digital chemistry

- Openness:
    - Open standards for e.g. electronic lab notebook data and schemas for chemical data are still required to encourage development of tools and ecosystem. Once available, these standards enable interoperability between closed systems provided by commercial or academic interests.
    - As mentioned above, open standards can be proliferated from the top-down via stipulations on funding, publishing or instrument purchasing, or from bottom-up by open source tool developers and institutional offerings.
    - Although it is not feasible for all tools to be free (both as in beer and as in speech), an open source ecosystem must be fostered to enable equitable global uptake and proliferation of best practices.
- Usability & extensibility of tools:
    - Streamlining of data entry and investment in modern tools; web interfaces are now much more adaptable.
    - Supporting next-generation lab notebooks that add value to data entry by using semantic web technologies, natural language processing or community standards for structured data.
    - Modularity of tools, such that the software components themselves can be interoperably employed. This allows for the rapid development of bespoke or niche offerings such that research is minimally constrained by the available open data tools (for example, data entry tools should be able to accommodate the development of new schema for a novel measurement technique).
- People
    - adopting a more communitarian approach, user-driven developments and crowd-sourcing.
    - Lobbying for increased funding for software, tools and training to reduce the burden on individual researchers.
