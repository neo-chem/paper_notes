# Potential solutions

We now discuss facets of potential solutions to the problems that are limiting the digitization of chemistry.

- Openness: 
    - Open standards for e.g. lab notebook data and schemas for chemical data are required for development of tools and ecosystems
    - Enables interoperability between closed systems provided by commercial interests. 
    - Can be proliferated from the top-down via stipulations on funding, publishing or instrument purchasing, or from bottom-up by open source tool developers and institutional offerings.
    - Free (both as in beer and as in speech) tools required can enable equitable uptake
- Usability: 
    - Streamlining of data entry and investment in modern tools; web interfaces are now much more adaptable.
    - Supporting next-generation lab notebooks that use semantic web technologies, natural language processing or community standards for structured data.
- People
    - adopting a more communitarian approach, user-driven developments and crowd sourcing. 
    - Funding for software, tools and training
    - Digitizing the chemistry curriculum, software and data carpentry
