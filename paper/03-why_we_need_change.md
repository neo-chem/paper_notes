# Why we need change

Intro to describe how COVID-19 has demonstrated how flawed the current methods are. E.g. lack of people in the lab, harder to collaborate in person, need to be able to access things from home/outside the lab, don’t want to touch other people’s lab books etc. We need to future proof things to stop a global pandemic shutting us down again.
Are there studies of how the old way of working has failed, either recently or further back?

## 3.1. Potential Benefits

one good aspect that would call my attention for ELN within an organic chemistry lab is the possibility to create an in-house database of reactions. Eventually, the PI could explore such a database for a publication of successes and errors to make it openly available to help spread the body of knowledge
Another point, specifically for what me and Stefan are trying to achieve, in a natural products lab, groups should be able to draw structures in their ELN (instead of their paper notebook) with numbers and data (e.g. NMR chemical shift), again, for an in-house database following by a (simplified) submission into open-access databases. These type of connections would be great to improve how users see the data and to enable better prodictions of known compounds and steps.

### Openness & reproducibility

- I personally feel this argument has been “won” but we can certainly reinforce it
- Having simple metadata like date/time can really help in some cases i guess 
- Definitively knowing date+time could be important for questions of priority (ex: patents, discoveries). I don't think this will be all that relevant for most researchers, but big/influential institutions and companies that think they might benefit from this could help push for greater adoption.
- Enables citizen science 
- Acceleration of research (https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.1149) both locally and globally;
- A good tool should not only improve the research experience of the individual, but also accelerate the field by proliferation of data (metastudies, ML models etc become much easier) and best practices (even lowering the barrier to certain techniques)
- More prepared for scientific work outside academia
- Makes collaboration easier 
- Helps onboarding of new students/postdocs is there is already an established data collection and analysis workflow
PIs are able to access data and analysis years after the relevant group member has left, effective back ups, etc.
- Indeed, there are often stories that reactions that some postdoc that has already left has done are now repeated by new PhD students (as they have no easy way to check what already has been done in the group) 
- No effort to publish all data ("open notebook science"), also including failed reactions. This could avoid the replication of reactions that "fail" 
- I never used an open notebook myself (other than LabNote for a little while in the postdoc) and I struggle with paper notebooks by my few students. So this open notebooks have DOI? Could they be cited somehow?
- If there is a consistent schema, it is easy to harvest this data for ML and this might be an instant benefit

### Future Proof Scientific Research

- Ensuring it is there for coming generations
- Make it about recording everything well rather than only capturing what you want other people to see
- Requires a change of attitude
- Lots of the things that don't get digitised are things that don't work, failed experiments, or initial versions of protocols that have subsequently been tweaked. We should shtill capture these things as a non result is just as important as a result, and it would stop unecessary duplication of effortsla
- Detaching data from interpretation
- Almost always viewed through the lens of a paper, but digitisation allows for re-use and reinterpretation
- Potentially radical forms of collaboration and credit for doing science (e.g. citations of data from "failed" expts)
