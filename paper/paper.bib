	abstract = {Electronic Laboratory Notebooks (ELN) have been used in scientific laboratories for their flexibility in collecting non-standardized data. Microsoft OneNote emerges as a useful working tool for different educational institutions where technology allows you to optimize your resources. Because of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, over 850 million students in the world have been affected, so that 1 in 4 students has had to adapt to non-classroom learning conditions. In the present study, an analysis of the perception of the use of Microsoft OneNote as an ELN were carried out for students from three engineering degrees at the Universidad Politécnica Salesiana in Quito, in Ecuador during the months of April to June 2020. The results show that students rate the use of this tool as useful (52\%) to very useful (36\%) compared to a paper notebook. Also, most of the students ({\textgreater}80\%) recommend the use of the electronic notebook in the laboratory’s development practices, they would recommend its use to other students and teachers. Finally, the general perception was rated as good (37\%) and very good (32\%). These results allow to conclude that the use of electronic resources is accepted by students, adopting information and communication technologies (ICT) to enhance virtual education in pandemic times.},

	abstract = {There have been major disruptions to all parts of life due to COVID 19, including learning and teaching at universities. For universities, material for lectures, tutorials/workshops and laboratories that were originally taught as face-to-face activities were shifted online. For lecturers, this meant re-thinking the design of learning activities and assessment. For students, this meant changing the way that they studied, particularly when faced with reduced peer interaction and face-to-face contact with teaching staff.

Electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) are currently being used in many undergraduate courses to help students develop record-keeping and data management skills. ELNs have also been an efficient way for delivering online laboratory content to students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Two first year chemistry unit coordinators at Curtin University took advantage of this functionality. Additionally, students were encouraged to use the built-in communication tools in the chosen ELN, LabArchives, to get help and interact with teaching staff and peers.

This presentation will outline the changes made in a very short time frame to two first year chemistry units when all classes moved to online formats. Student experiences will be described, as well as the experience of teaching staff – both lecturers and sessional staff. One outcome we know is that students adapted to online learning much quicker because of the ELN, and were able to get feedback and respond to it during the semester. Any changes made that were well received will be used in future semesters.

	abstract = {Scientific research is increasingly characterised by the volume of documents and data that it produces, from experimental plans and raw data to reports and papers. Researchers frequently struggle to manage and curate these materials, both individually and collectively. Previous studies of Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) in academia and industry have identified semantic web technologies as a means for organising scientific documents to improve current workflows and knowledge management practices. In this paper, we present a qualitative, user-centred study of researcher requirements and practices, based on a series of discipline-specific focus groups. We developed a prototype semantic ELN to serve as a discussion aid for these focus groups, and to help us explore the technical readiness of a range of semantic web technologies. While these technologies showed potential, existing tools for semantic annotation were not well-received by our focus groups, and need to be refined before they can be used to enhance current researcher practices. In addition, the seemingly simple notion of “tagging and searching” documents appears anything but; the researchers in our focus groups had extremely personal requirements for how they organise their work, so the successful incorporation of semantic web technologies into their practices must permit a significant degree of customisation and personalisation.},

The relationship with the related subject of bioinformatics is becoming stronger and better defined, owing to the influence of Semantic Web technologies, which enable researchers to integrate hetero- geneous sources of chemical, biochemical, biological, and medical information. These developments depend on a range of factors: the principles of chemical identifiers and their role in relationships between chemical and biological enti- ties; the importance of preserving provenance and properly curated metadata; and an understanding of the contribution that the Semantic Web can make at all stages of the research lifecycle. The movements toward open access, open source, and open collaboration all contribute to progress toward the goals of integration.},

We present an approach where semantic metadata is generated as scientific data is being prepared, and then subsequently used to configure models and to customize them to the data. The metadata captured includes sensor descriptions, data characteristics, data types, and process documentation. This metadata is then used in a workflow system to select analytic models dynamically and to set up model parameters automatically. In addition, all aspects of data processing are documented, and the system is able to generate extensive provenance records for new data products based on the metadata. As a result, the system can dynamically select analytic models based on the metadata properties of the data it is processing, generating more accurate results. We show results in analyzing stream metabolism for watershed ecosystem management.},

a cumbersome process. To allay some of the strain associated with an exhaustive search through notebook technologies, this paper details some key features from a pool of 35 electronic notebooks available today. This review effectively classifies these notebooks into five categories based on market audience as follows: notebooks suited for a Quality environment can be found within the Quality Assurance/Quality Control pool. Notebooks suited for specialized tasks in Biology or Chemistry can be found within the Biology or Chemistry pools, respectively. Notebooks that are suitable for general science functionalities can be found under either the Research and Development or the Multidiscipline pools. Lastly, notebooks that are designed and developed for the spectrum of stringent Quality laboratories to free- form research laboratories can be found within the Multidiscipline pool. The guidelines put forth in this paper eliminate the need to perform an exhaustive search for a suitable notebook. (JALA 2011;16:90–8)},

	abstract = {Prolific adoption of digital media across scientific fields has led to inevitable transformation of a traditional lab book into an electronic lab notebook (ELN). Research so far has focussed on designing ELN prototypes and learning from their limited deployments. At the same time, a variety of commercially available ELNs have been adopted by industrial and academic laboratories. That provides opportunities for situated research and a deeper understanding of the role that ELNs assumes as an integral part of a scientific environment. In this paper we present a study of ELN design that has emerged as scientists appropriated commercial off-the-shelf note-taking software and adapted it to their work. Through in-situ observations we analysed the interplay between the technology and emerging practices. Our study reveals a tension that is intrinsic to the digital nature of ELNs: a conflict between the flexibility, fluidity, and low threshold for modifying digital records and the requirement for persistence and consistency. This led to refined requirements and design considerations for ELNs.},

The 1996 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) allowed notebook records that were generated outside of the US to be used to claim precedence in US patent claims. This agreement spurred interest in the development of ELNs in Europe. The pharmaceutical research process became dependent on computer systems during the latter part of the 1990s, and this also led to a wider interest in ELNs. More recently, the FDA began to encourage submissions in an all- electronic form, leading to great interest in the use of ELNs in development and manufacturing. As a result of these influences, the pharmaceutical industry is now actively pursuing ELN evaluations and implementations.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03842},
	abstract = {Ontologies order and interconnect knowledge of a certain field in a formal and semantic way so that they are machine-parsable. They try to define allwhere acceptable definition of concepts and objects, classify them, provide properties as well as interconnect them with relations (e.g. "A is a special case of B"). More precisely, Tom Gruber defines Ontologies as a "specification of a conceptualization; [...] a description (like a formal specification of a program) of the concepts and relationships that can exist for an agent or a community of agents." [1] An Ontology is made of Individuals which are organized in Classes. Both can have Attributes and Relations among themselves. Some complex Ontologies define Restrictions, Rules and Events which change attributes or relations. To be computer accessible they are written in certain ontology languages, like the OBO language or the more used Common Algebraic Specification Language. With the rising of a digitalized, interconnected and globalized world, where common standards have to be found, ontologies are of great interest. [2] Yet, the development of chemical ontologies is in the beginning. Indeed, some interesting basic approaches towards chemical ontologies can be found, but nevertheless they suffer from two main flaws. Firstly, we found that they are mostly only fragmentary completed or are still in an architecture state. Secondly, apparently no chemical ontology is widespread accepted. Therefore, we herein try to describe the major ontology-developments in the chemical related fields Ontologies about chemical analytical methods, Ontologies about name reactions and Ontologies about scientific units.},

	abstract = {The development of an electronic lab notebook (ELN) for researchers working in the field of chemical sciences is presented. The web based application is available as an Open Source software that offers modern solutions for chemical researchers. The Chemotion ELN is equipped with the basic functionalities necessary for the acquisition and processing of chemical data, in particular the work with molecular structures and calculations based on molecular properties. The ELN supports planning, description, storage, and management for the routine work of organic chemists. It also provides tools for communicating and sharing the recorded research data among colleagues. Meeting the requirements of a state of the art research infrastructure, the ELN allows the search for molecules and reactions not only within the user’s data but also in conventional external sources as provided by SciFinder and PubChem. The presented development makes allowance for the growing dependency of scientific activity on the availability of digital information by providing Open Source instruments to record and reuse research data. The current version of the ELN has been using for over half of a year in our chemistry research group, serves as a common infrastructure for chemistry research and enables chemistry researchers to build their own databases of digital information as a prerequisite for the detailed, systematic investigation and evaluation of chemical reactions and mechanisms.},

	abstract = {In order to exploit the vast body of currently inaccessible chemical information held in Electronic Laboratory Notebooks (ELNs) it is necessary not only to make it available but also to develop protocols for discovery, access and ultimately automatic processing. An aim of the Dial-a-Molecule Grand Challenge Network is to be able to draw on the body of accumulated chemical knowledge in order to predict or optimize the outcome of reactions. Accordingly the Network drew up a working group comprising informaticians, software developers and stakeholders from industry and academia to develop protocols and mechanisms to access and process ELN records. The work presented here constitutes the first stage of this process by proposing a tiered metadata system of knowledge, information and processing where each in turn addresses a) discovery, indexing and citation b) context and access to additional information and c) content access and manipulation. A compact set of metadata terms, called the elnItemManifest, has been derived and caters for the knowledge layer of this model. The elnItemManifest has been encoded as an XML schema and some use cases are presented to demonstrate the potential of this approach.},

	abstract = {The Analytical Information Markup Language (AnIML) is a standardization effort of ASTM (formerly American Society for Testing and Materials) Subcommittee E13.15 on Analytical Data. AnIML provides an XML-based format for analytical data. It is designed specifically for spectroscopy and chromatography data, but is suitable for use with many different analytical measurement techniques. AnIML consists of a generic core structure that permits the storage of arbitrary analytical data. These include multi-dimensional data, name-value pairs, and hierarchies. The concept of technique definitions permits the formal specification of constraints for usage of the core. This way, a definition can prescribe how the data for specific measurement techniques should be captured in the data file. To address changing requirements, AnIML supports an extension concept that allows vendors or end users to specify additional data that should be stored for a technique. These extensions can also be formally documented so that they do not break compatibility with existing software. This article presents an overview of AnIML and demonstrates how AnIML can be used to record data from everyday experimental workflows in a laboratoryenvironment. Issues related to the usage of AnIML in regulated environments are also discussed, including the use of digital signatures and audit trail functionality to ensure data integrity.},

The platform offers an interactive visualization and analytics environment that functions well on mobile, laptop and desktop devices. It offers pragmatic solutions to ensure that large and complex data sets are more accessible. Existing desktop applications/frameworks were extended to integrate with high-performance computing resources, and offer command-line tools to automate interaction—connecting distributed teams to this software platform on their own terms. The platform was developed openly, and all source code hosted on the GitHub platform with automated deployment possible using Ansible coupled with standard Ubuntu-based machine images deployed to cloud machines. The platform is designed to enable teams to reap the benefits of the connected web—going beyond what conventional search and analytics platforms offer in this area. It also has the goal of offering federated instances, that can be customized to the sites/research performed. Data gets stored using JSON, extending upon previous approaches using XML, building structures that support computational chemistry calculations. These structures were developed to make it easy to process data across different languages, and send data to a JavaScript-based web client.},

	abstract = {The movement to bring datasets into the scholarly record as first class research products (validated, preserved, cited, and credited) has been inching forward for some time, but now the pace is quickening. As data publication venues proliferate, significant debate continues over formats, processes, and terminology. Here, we present an overview of data publication initiatives underway and the current conversation, highlighting points of consensus and issues still in contention. Data publication implementations differ in a variety of factors, including the kind of documentation, the location of the documentation relative to the data, and how the data is validated. Publishers may present data as supplemental material to a journal article, with a descriptive “data paper,” or independently. Complicating the situation, different initiatives and communities use the same terms to refer to distinct but overlapping concepts. For instance, the term
published means that the data is publicly available and citable to virtually everyone, but it may or may not imply that the data has been peer-reviewed. In turn, what is meant by data peer review is far from defined; standards and processes encompass the full range employed in reviewing the literature, plus some novel variations. Basic data citation is a point of consensus, but the general agreement on the core elements of a dataset citation frays if the data is dynamic or part of a larger set. Even as data publication is being defined, some are looking past publication to other metaphors, notably “data as software,” for solutions to the more stubborn problems.},
